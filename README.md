# Anime Flick

We're building a Web app to allow users to search and store a record of movies, series and anime that they've seen. Movie and TV series lists will be stored on our servers. We will utilise the MyAnimeList API to allow the user to make changes to their anime list content on MyAnimeList.

Our [public Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/O9I2YLuO/movie-tracker) can be seen to see our plans and progress through out the development of this app.

We still haven't completely decided on a name for our app, so any ideas on the name of our web app or feature requests that you think would benifit the app would be gladly accepted.
